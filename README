Apache::Onanox README
---------------------

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Apache::Onanox aims to provide a framework for creating multiple user
websites. It provides functions for user and document creation and
maintenance. It is also user-customisable - the user can change the
fonts, sizes and colours. It also supports theming.

PREREQUISITES
-------------
- Apache with mod_perl installed
- MySQL
- Perl modules listed in Makefile.PL

If installed via CPAN, all perl module prerequisites will be installed.
Otherwise, look in Makefile.PL and install manually.

INSTALLATION
------------
Install the perl modules in the usual way:
perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

Install the database. Edit install_db and fix the database username
and password. 'mysql' must be in your path.
./install_db

Copy conf/onanox.conf and conf/startup.pl to your Apache configuration
directory, and add this line to the bottom of your httpd.conf:
include onanox.conf

Edit onanox.conf and replace the username and password with your 
database username and password.

Shutdown Apache, start it up again.
